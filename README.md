#  Commando

## What is it?

Commando is vaguely inspired by Apple MPW's Commando feature that let you build simple GUIs for your command line tools.

Commando is a command line tool that takes a syntax description file for a command line invocation, shows a window with controls for configuring these options, and then returns what settings were chosen in that GUI in a form that should make it easy to build the command line from it and call it.
